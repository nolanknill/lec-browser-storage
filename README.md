For this demo, you'll have to install and run the server found in `/server` along with the react application found in `/client`

## Installation

1. Start the client:
    1. `cd client`
    2. `npm install && npm start`
    
2. Open another terminal window so your react application continues to run.

3. Start the server:
    1. `cd ../server`
    2. `npm install && npm start`
